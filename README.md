# Search Binary Code in Python

## Introduction
This repository contains a Python script that implements the search binary algorithm. The search binary algorithm is a fast and efficient method for finding a specific element in a sorted list or array.

## How it Works
The search binary algorithm works by repeatedly dividing the search space in half until the desired element is found. It compares the target element with the middle element of the search space and determines whether to continue searching in the lower or upper half. This process is repeated until the target element is found or the search space is empty.

## Usage
To use the search binary code, follow these steps:
1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
3. Open the terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the main Python file is located.
4. Run the Python script using the command python main.py.
5. Enter the target element you want to search for when prompted.
6. The program will output whether the element was found or not, along with its index if it exists in the list.

## Example
Here is an example usage of the search binary code:

python
# Sample sorted list
my_list = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9,... 97, 98, 99, 100]

# Running the search binary algorithm
target = 34
result = binary_search(my_list, target)

if result != -1:
    print(f"Element {target} found at index {result}")
else:
    print("Element not found in the list")
